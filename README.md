# YoutubeVideo_Q-A
Integrates OpenAi, vector database RAG into the simple app which can answer any related questions using the video content

The purpose of this project is to learn primarily how to use the following and get an idea about it:
- Langchain
- RAG Vector DB
- OpenAi

Conceptually to work with an LLM, one needs to gather context so that the LLM can use it as context and this can be really helpful when trying to work with data that may not be public info. (OpenAi does not store or use data from api calls for training models)

## To get it running:
1. Create a `.env` file
2. Populate it with `OPENAI_API_KEY=< INSERT YOUR OpenAI API KEY >`

Read through if you want in doc, or just execute the parts of code.
